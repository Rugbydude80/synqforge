# Environment Configuration

## Development
| Variable | Required | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string for Drizzle ORM | Use a local database; no connection is opened until server runtime. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Session encryption key for NextAuth | Generate via `openssl rand -base64 32`. Needed even for local testing. |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Optional | Absolute URL for auth callbacks & email links | Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`; set when testing password reset emails. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | Access key for Claude-based AI features | Required to exercise AI routes; leave unset to skip AI locally. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Optional | Redis REST endpoint for rate limiting | Provide with token to enable Upstash-backed limits; otherwise routes allow all requests. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Optional | Auth token for Upstash rate limiting | Must accompany `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional | Email delivery via Resend | Without it, reset emails log to console in dev. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Optional | From address for auth emails | Defaults to `SynqForge <onboarding@resend.dev>` if unset. |
