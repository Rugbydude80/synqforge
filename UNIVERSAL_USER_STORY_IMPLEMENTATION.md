## 📋 Generated Story Format

```markdown
**Title:** As a product manager, I want to upload PRD documents, so that I can automatically generate user stories

**Background/Context:**
Product managers spend 5-10 hours per week manually writing user stories from PRDs. This feature automates story generation, reducing time-to-backlog by 80% and ensuring consistency across the team.

**Source Artefact:**
- Document: Product_Requirements_v2.0.pdf
- Page/Section: Section 3.2 - Backlog Automation
- Quote: "The system shall ingest PRD documents and generate structured user stories with acceptance criteria"

**Description:**
This feature allows users to upload product requirement documents (PDF, DOCX, Markdown) and automatically generates Epics, User Stories, and Tasks using AI. The system validates document format, extracts requirements, maps dependencies, and flags potential duplicates against existing backlog items.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **GIVEN** a user has a valid PRD document (PDF, DOCX, MD) under 2MB **WHEN** they upload via the Autopilot interface **THEN** the system accepts the file and displays upload success confirmation
2. **GIVEN** an uploaded document contains at least one feature description **WHEN** AI processing completes **THEN** the system generates at least 1 Epic with minimum 2 User Stories
3. **GIVEN** generated stories exist **WHEN** admin policy requires review **THEN** all stories are placed in review queue with no auto-publishing
4. **GIVEN** a generated story overlaps ≥70% with an existing story **WHEN** processing completes **THEN** the system flags the duplicate with merge suggestion and diff view
5. **GIVEN** cross-story references exist (e.g., "after user signup") **WHEN** processing completes **THEN** dependencies are mapped with source/target story IDs

**Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA):**
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard access to upload interface, Tab/Enter/Space support
- Screen reader: Upload progress announced, file validation errors read aloud, ARIA labels on all controls
- Colour contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 for all text, 3:1 for UI components
- Focus indicators: Visible 2px outline on all interactive elements

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on: User Authentication (Story #AUTH-123)
- Blocks: Epic Review Workflow (Story #REV-456)

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time collaboration during document upload
- Image extraction from PDF documents
- Video file support
- OCR for scanned documents

**Notes:**
- Maximum file size enforced at API gateway level (2MB)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet used for story generation
- Token usage tracked against organisation quota
- Processing typically takes 10-30 seconds for standard PRDs
```

## 🔄 Data Transformation

The service now transforms AI-generated stories into a rich, structured format:

### Epic Format
```typescript
{
  id: "epic-id",
  title: "Epic title",
  description: "Epic description\n\n**Source Artefact:**\n- Document: filename\n- Section: section\n- Quote: \"exact quote\""
}
```

### Story Format
```typescript
{
  id: "story-id",
  epicId: "epic-id",
  title: "As a... I want... So that...",
  description: "**Background/Context:**\n...\n\n**Source Artefact:**\n...\n\n**Description:**\n...\n\n**Accessibility Requirements:**\n...\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n...\n\n**Notes:**\n...",
  acceptanceCriteria: [
    "**GIVEN** ... **WHEN** ... **THEN** ...",
    "**GIVEN** ... **WHEN** ... **THEN** ..."
  ],
  estimatedEffort: 5,
  dependencies: ["Story title"]
}
```

## ✅ Validation Checklist

The AI prompt includes a validation checklist ensuring:

- ✓ Title uses "As a... I want... so that..." format
- ✓ At least 3 ACs, maximum 10 ACs
- ✓ Each AC is atomic (one behaviour only)
- ✓ Each AC uses **GIVEN** **WHEN** **THEN** with bold formatting
- ✓ Source artefact includes document, section, and exact quote
- ✓ Accessibility requirements included for UI features
- ✓ UK English spelling throughout
- ✓ GBP currency if monetary values mentioned
- ✓ No invented features - only what's in the document

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Sample Input Document
```markdown
# PRD: User Authentication

## Section 1: Login Feature
Users need to log in with email and password. The system must validate credentials and redirect to dashboard on success. Failed logins should show error messages.

## Section 2: Security
All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt. Sessions expire after 24 hours.
```
