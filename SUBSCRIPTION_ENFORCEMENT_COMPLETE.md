# Subscription Enforcement - Complete Audit & Fixes

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

## 🎯 Overview

Comprehensive audit and implementation of subscription limits across all resource creation and AI operations. All critical gaps have been identified and fixed.

---

## 📋 WHAT WAS DONE

### Phase 1: Resource Creation Limits ✅

**Fixed Endpoints**:
1. **Project Creation** (`/api/projects`)
   - Added `canCreateProject()` enforcement
   - Returns 402 when limit exceeded
   - Enforces: Free (1), Solo (3), Business+ (unlimited)

2. **Story Creation** (`/api/stories`)
   - Added `canCreateStory()` enforcement
   - Per-project limit checking
   - Enforces: Free (50/project), Solo (200/project), Business+ (unlimited)

**Audited & Confirmed**:
- ✅ **Sprints**: Unlimited for all tiers (no limits needed)
- ✅ **Tasks**: Unlimited for all tiers (industry standard)
- ✅ **Templates**: Feature-flagged via `canUseTemplates` (Free: blocked, Solo+: allowed)
- ✅ **Epics**: Unlimited for all tiers (naturally constrained by project limits)

---

### Phase 2: AI Token & Generation Limits ✅

**Audit Results**: **ALL AI endpoints fully protected** with dual-layer enforcement:

**Protected Endpoints**:
1. ✅ `POST /api/ai/generate-stories` - Token + bulk + rate limits
2. ✅ `POST /api/ai/generate-epic` - Token + rate limits
3. ✅ `POST /api/ai/validate-story` - Token + rate limits
4. ✅ `POST /api/ai/analyze-document` - Token + doc ingestion + rate limits
5. ✅ `POST /api/stories/[storyId]/ai-split-suggestions` - Token + rate limits
6. ✅ All advanced AI services (backlog-autopilot, planning-forecast, etc.)

**Enforcement Layers**:
- **Layer 1**: Fair Usage Guards (hard blocks on token depletion)
- **Layer 2**: AI Usage Service (legacy validation + tracking)
- **Layer 3**: Rate Limiting (prevents burst abuse)
- **Layer 4**: Feature Flags (tier-based feature access)

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS

### Test Project Limit (Free Tier):
```bash
# Set org to free tier
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE organizations SET subscription_tier = 'free' WHERE id = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';"

# Create a project (should succeed if under limit)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Project","key":"TST"}'

# Try creating second project (should fail with 402)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Second Project","key":"SEC"}'

# Expected: 402 with message "You've reached your project limit (1/1). Upgrade to create more projects."
```

### Test Story Limit (Free Tier):
```bash
# Assuming you have a project with 50 stories already

curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/stories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title":"51st Story","projectId":"YOUR_PROJECT_ID"}'

# Expected: 402 with message "You've reached the story limit for this project (50/50). Upgrade for unlimited stories."
```

### Test AI Token Limit:
```bash
# Set token usage to 90% (warning threshold)
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE workspace_usage SET tokens_used = 18000 WHERE organization_id = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';"

# Make AI request - should succeed with warning
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/ai/generate-stories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"requirements":"Login feature","projectContext":"Web app","projectId":"xxx"}'

# Expected: 200 with fairUsageWarning in response

# Set token usage to 100%
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE workspace_usage SET tokens_used = 20000 WHERE organization_id = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';"

# Make AI request - should fail
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/ai/generate-stories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"requirements":"Login feature","projectContext":"Web app","projectId":"xxx"}'

# Expected: 402 with "AI token limit reached" message
```

## 📊 MONITORING

### What to Monitor Post-Deployment:

1. **Blocked Requests** (should be in logs):
```
🚫 Project creation blocked - limit reached
🚫 Story creation blocked - limit reached
🚫 AI token limit reached
```

2. **Upgrade Conversions**:
- Track 402 responses → users visiting `/pricing`
- Monitor free → paid tier conversions

3. **Token Consumption**:
- Average tokens/day per tier
- Top consumers (potential upsell targets)
- Token exhaustion rate

4. **False Positives**:
- Users reporting legitimate blocks
- Potential bugs in limit calculation

### Sentry/Logging:
```javascript
// Already implemented in code:
console.warn('🚫 Project creation blocked - limit reached:', {
  userId,
  organizationId,
  currentCount,
  maxAllowed,
  tier
})
```

## 🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT

### Revenue Protection:
- ✅ Prevents free tier abuse
- ✅ Creates natural upgrade pressure
- ✅ Fair usage across all customers
- ✅ Protects against token overconsumption

### User Experience:
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Direct upgrade paths
- ✅ Advance warnings (90% threshold)
- ✅ No surprises (limits documented)

### Operational:
- ✅ Automated enforcement (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Billing-aligned tracking (monthly resets)
- ✅ Scalable (database-backed)
- ✅ Observable (detailed logging)

---

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)

### Considered but Not Implemented:

1. **Token Rollover** (10-20% unused tokens to next month)
2. **Token Pooling** (team members share token pool)
3. **Usage Dashboard** (real-time UI showing consumption)
4. **Email Alerts** (75%, 90%, 100% notifications)
5. **Token Marketplace** (buy/sell between teams)
6. **Model Selection** (cheaper models for simple tasks)

### Why Not Now:
- Current implementation is sufficient for MVP
- Want to gather usage data first
- These add complexity without proven ROI yet
- Can be added later based on customer feedback
