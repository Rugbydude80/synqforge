# Booster Package Fix - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND READY TO DEPLOY**

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**Critical Bug**: Users could purchase token booster packages ($5-$35) via Stripe, tokens were stored in database, but users **couldn't use them** because the AI enforcement system never checked purchased token balance.

**Impact**: Revenue risk, customer dissatisfaction, potential refunds/chargebacks

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix: `canUseAI()` Function

**File**: `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` (lines 110-147)

**What Changed**:
- Now checks `tokenBalances` table when monthly limit is reached
- Allows AI operations if purchased tokens available
- Provides clear messaging about purchased token usage

**Logic Flow**:
```
1. Check monthly allowance
2. If insufficient → Check purchased tokens
3. If purchased tokens >= required → ALLOW ✅
4. If no purchased tokens → BLOCK with purchase option
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Checks purchased balance dynamically
- ✅ Clear console logging for debugging
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Shows combined available tokens in errors

---

### 2. Backend Fix: `incrementTokenUsage()` Function

**File**: `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` (lines 164-242)

**What Changed**:
- Intelligently uses monthly tokens first, then purchased tokens
- Handles three scenarios:
  1. Under monthly limit → Use monthly tokens
  2. Over monthly limit → Use purchased tokens only
  3. Crosses the boundary → Split between monthly and purchased

**Logic Flow**:
```
Case 1: tokensUsed < tokensRemaining
→ Increment monthly usage only

Case 2: tokensRemaining = 0
→ Deduct from purchased balance only

Case 3: tokensUsed > tokensRemaining > 0
→ Use remaining monthly tokens
→ Deduct overflow from purchased balance
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Automatic token source selection
- ✅ Seamless handling of edge cases
- ✅ Detailed logging for each scenario
- ✅ No user intervention required

---

### 3. Frontend Enhancement: Usage Display

**File**: `components/usage-dashboard.tsx` (lines 187-201)

**What Changed**:
- Added purchased token indicator in Token Usage card
- Shows "+ X purchased tokens available" below monthly usage
- Purple/brand color styling to highlight purchased tokens
- Shopping cart icon for visual clarity

**Visual Improvement**:
```
Before:
Token Usage
18,000 / 20,000
[Progress bar]
10% remaining (2,000 tokens)

After:
Token Usage
18,000 / 20,000
[Progress bar]
10% remaining (2,000 tokens)
🛒 + 50,000 purchased tokens available
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monthly Limit Reached, Purchase Booster ✅

**Steps**:
1. Organization uses 20,000/20,000 monthly tokens
2. AI request → 402 Payment Required
3. User purchases $5 booster (50,000 tokens)
4. Stripe webhook adds tokens to database
5. AI request → **200 Success** ✅

**Expected Logs**:
```
🎯 Using purchased tokens for org ORG_ID: 5,000 tokens (50,000 available)
💰 Deducted 5,000 tokens from purchased balance (org: ORG_ID)
```

**Database Changes**:
- `token_balances.usedTokens`: 0 → 5,000
- `token_balances.totalTokens`: 50,000 → 45,000

---

### Scenario 2: Split Usage Across Monthly and Purchased ✅

**Steps**:
1. Organization has 2,000 monthly tokens remaining
2. User has 50,000 purchased tokens
3. AI operation needs 5,000 tokens
4. System should: Use 2,000 monthly + 3,000 purchased

**Expected Logs**:
```
🔄 Split token usage for org ORG_ID: 2,000 monthly + 3,000 purchased
```

**Database Changes**:
- `workspace_usage.tokensUsed`: 18,000 → 20,000 (maxed)
- `token_balances.usedTokens`: 0 → 3,000
- `token_balances.totalTokens`: 50,000 → 47,000

---

### Scenario 3: 90% Warning with Purchased Tokens ✅

**Steps**:
1. Organization at 90% monthly usage (18,000/20,000)
2. User has 50,000 purchased tokens
3. AI request → Success with warning

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stories": [...],
  "fairUsageWarning": "Warning: 90% of AI tokens used (18,000/20,000)"
}
```

**UI Display**:
- ⚠️ Yellow warning banner
- Shows: "You've used 18,000 of 20,000 tokens (90%)"
- Also shows: "+ 50,000 purchased tokens available"
- CTA: "View Plans" button

---

### Scenario 4: Both Limits Exhausted ✅

**Steps**:
1. Organization: 20,000/20,000 monthly
2. Organization: 0 purchased tokens remaining
3. AI request → 402 Payment Required

**Expected Error**:
```json
{
  "error": "AI token limit reached (20,000 tokens/month). Purchase more tokens or upgrade your plan.",
  "upgradeUrl": "/settings/billing",
  "used": 20000,
  "limit": 20000,
  "percentage": 100
}
```

## 📈 Expected Business Impact

### Before Fix ❌

- Users pay $5-$35 for tokens
- Tokens stored but unusable
- 100% refund rate expected
- Customer support tickets
- Negative reviews
- Platform trust damaged

### After Fix ✅

- Users pay → tokens work immediately
- Seamless experience
- Revenue generation functional
- Self-service token purchases
- Reduced support load
- Increased customer satisfaction

### Revenue Projection

**Token Packages**:
- Small: $5 (50K tokens) - Break-even on 5 story generations
- Medium: $12 (150K tokens) - 20% discount, best value
- Large: $35 (500K tokens) - 30% discount, power users

**Target Customers**:
- Free tier users hitting limits (push to paid)
- Core/Pro users needing extra capacity (incremental revenue)
- Seasonal users (one-time purchases vs monthly)

**Expected Adoption**:
- 10-20% of free users at limit will purchase vs upgrade
- 5-10% of paid users will buy additional tokens
- Average purchase: $12 (medium package)

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Purchase Conversion**:
   - Blocked requests → Token purchases
   - 402 responses → Checkout sessions
   - Target: 10-15% conversion

2. **Token Usage**:
   - Monthly vs purchased token usage ratio
   - Average purchased tokens per org
   - Token exhaustion rate

3. **Revenue**:
   - Token package sales by size
   - MRR from token purchases
   - Token purchase frequency

4. **Customer Success**:
   - Purchased tokens actually used (should be 100%)
   - Time to first use after purchase
   - Repeat purchase rate

### Logging to Monitor

```
✅ Look for these logs in production:
🎯 Using purchased tokens for org...
💰 Deducted X tokens from purchased balance...
🔄 Split token usage for org...
✅ Incremented monthly usage for org...
```

```
🚫 Alert on these errors:
❌ No workspace usage found for org...
❌ Failed to deduct tokens...
❌ Error checking purchased balance...
```

## 🎓 How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)

### Token Consumption Priority

```
Priority 1: Monthly Allowance (Free resource)
↓ exhausted?
Priority 2: Purchased Tokens (Paid resource)
↓ exhausted?
Block → Prompt to buy more
```

### Database Tables

**`workspace_usage`** (Monthly Allowance):
- `tokensUsed`: Current month consumption
- `tokensLimit`: Monthly tier allowance
- Auto-resets: First day of each month

**`token_balances`** (Purchased Tokens):
- `purchasedTokens`: Total ever purchased
- `usedTokens`: Total ever used from purchases
- `totalTokens`: purchasedTokens - usedTokens
- Never auto-resets (persist until used)

## 📞 Support & Rollback

### If Issues Arise

**Quick Disable** (Emergency):
```typescript
// In lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts
const ENABLE_PURCHASED_TOKENS = false // Temporarily disable

if (ENABLE_PURCHASED_TOKENS && tokensRemaining <= 0) {
  // Check purchased tokens...
}
```

**Rollback Plan**:
1. Revert `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` to previous version
2. System will work as before (ignore purchased tokens)
3. Purchased tokens remain in database for future fix
4. No data loss

**Customer Communication** (if needed):
"We're temporarily pausing purchased token usage while we optimize the feature. Your purchased tokens are safe and will be available once we complete our maintenance."
