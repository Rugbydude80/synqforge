## 🎯 Changes Made

### File Modified
- **`app/auth/signup/page.tsx`** - Complete pricing update

### Key Updates

1. **Import Plans Data**
   ```typescript
   import plansData from '@/config/plans.json'
   ```
   Now using the single source of truth instead of hardcoded data

2. **Updated Plan IDs**
   - `free` → `starter`
   - `solo` → `pro_solo`
   - `team` → `team` (kept same)
   - `pro` → `pro_collaborative`
   - `enterprise` → `enterprise` (kept same)

3. **Corrected Prices**
   - Pro (Solo): £19 → £10.99 ✅
   - Pro (Collaborative): £29 → £19.99 ✅
   - Team: £29 → £16.99 ✅
   - Enterprise: £299 → Custom ✅

4. **Added Features from plans.json**
   - Dynamically loads features from `config/plans.json`
   - Shows first 4 features for each tier
   - Consistent with main pricing page

5. **Updated Logic**
   - Changed default plan from `free` to `starter`
   - Updated free plan checks: `selectedPlan !== 'starter'`
   - Fixed price display for custom pricing (Enterprise)
   - Added proper null handling for Enterprise "Custom" pricing

6. **Icons Updated**
   - Added `Users` icon for Pro (Collaborative) and Team
   - More visual distinction between tiers

    ↓

    ↓
Creates account
    ↓
Redirects to Stripe (paid) or Dashboard (free)
```

---

## 🎯 Consistency Achieved

Both pages now show **identical pricing**:

✅ `/pricing` page (main marketing page)  
✅ `/auth/signup` page (signup flow)  
✅ Both using `config/plans.json` as single source of truth

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

The signup page is now **production-ready** with correct 2025 pricing:

1. ✅ Prices corrected
2. ✅ Plans synchronized with plans.json
3. ✅ Build successful
4. ✅ Ready to deploy

Once deployed, the live site will show:
- Correct pricing on signup
- Consistent with marketing pages
- Aligned with Stripe product setup

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Backward Compatibility:** The system will still accept `free` as a plan ID and convert it to `starter`
- **Features Display:** Showing first 4 features per plan on signup (full list on pricing page)
- **Enterprise Handling:** Shows "Custom" instead of a price, encourages contact sales
- **Most Popular:** Pro (Collaborative) is highlighted as most popular choice
