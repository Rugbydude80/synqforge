# AI Story Split Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented AI-powered story splitting functionality for production. Users can now click "Suggest Splits" in the Split Story modal to get intelligent, AI-generated child story suggestions based on INVEST principles and SPIDR heuristics.

## Changes Made

### 1. AI Service Enhancement (`lib/services/ai.service.ts`)

**Added Interfaces:**
- `StorySplitSuggestion` - Represents a single AI-generated child story suggestion
- `StorySplitResponse` - Complete response from AI split operation including suggestions, strategy, and token usage

**Added Methods:**
- `suggestStorySplit()` - Main method that sends story context to Claude AI and receives split suggestions
- `buildStorySplitPrompt()` - Constructs detailed prompt with INVEST/SPIDR analysis for AI
- `parseStorySplitResponse()` - Parses and validates AI response, ensuring all suggestions meet quality standards

**Prompt Engineering:**
The AI prompt includes:
- Original story details (title, description, points, acceptance criteria)
- INVEST analysis results (Valuable, Independent, Small, Testable, Estimable)
- SPIDR opportunities (Spike, Paths, Interfaces, Data, Rules)
- Strict requirements for child stories (2+ acceptance criteria, 1-5 points, user value)
- Guidance on vertical vs horizontal slicing

**Model Used:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (for high-quality splitting suggestions)

### 2. API Endpoint (`app/api/stories/[storyId]/ai-split-suggestions/route.ts`)

**New Endpoint:** `GET /api/stories/:storyId/ai-split-suggestions`

**Features:**
- Rate limiting (10 AI requests per minute per user)
- Fair usage enforcement (checks AI token limits)
- Story access validation
- INVEST/SPIDR pre-analysis
- Token usage tracking in database
- Comprehensive error handling for:
  - Rate limits (429)
  - AI usage limits (402)
  - Story not found (404)
  - AI generation failures (500)

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [...],
  "splitStrategy": "Approach used (e.g., 'Split by user paths')",
  "reasoning": "Explanation of why this split makes sense",
  "analysis": { /* INVEST/SPIDR analysis */ },
  "usage": {
    "promptTokens": 1200,
    "completionTokens": 800,
    "totalTokens": 2000
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

#### `components/story-split/ChildrenEditor.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `storyId` prop (required for API calls)
- Added `isLoadingAI` state for loading indicator
- Converted `suggestSplits()` from rule-based to AI-powered async function
- Integrated toast notifications for success/error states
- Added comprehensive error handling for:
  - Rate limit errors (429)
  - Billing/upgrade required (402)
  - General failures
- Updated button UI to show loading state with spinner
- Added upgrade prompt with link for users who hit limits

**User Experience:**
- Click "Suggest Splits" button
- See "Generating..." with spinner while AI works
- Get toast notification with number of suggestions and strategy used
- Child stories populate automatically in editor
- Can still manually edit or add more stories

#### `components/story-split/SplitStoryModal.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Pass `storyId` prop to `ChildrenEditor` component

### 4. Constants Update (`lib/constants.ts`)

**Added:**
```typescript
AI_TOKEN_COSTS: {
  STORY_SPLIT: 2500, // Average for splitting a story into 2-5 child stories
}
```

This ensures accurate token usage tracking and fair usage enforcement.

### 5. Documentation Update (`docs/STORY_SPLIT_FEATURE.md`)

**Added Section:** "AI-Powered Split Suggestions"
- Detailed explanation of how AI splitting works
- API documentation with example request/response
- Fair usage information
- Token cost estimates

## Technical Details

### AI Token Estimation
- Average cost: ~2,500 tokens per split operation
- Includes both prompt (story context + INVEST/SPIDR analysis) and completion (2-5 child stories)
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for high-quality results

### Fair Usage Integration
- Respects organization's monthly AI token pool
- Enforces rate limits (10 requests/min)
- Shows upgrade prompts for Free tier users
- Tracks all usage in `ai_generations` database table

### Validation
The AI response parser validates each suggestion has:
- Non-empty title, personaGoal, and description
- At least 2 acceptance criteria
- Story points between 1-5
- Boolean `providesUserValue` flag
- Filters out invalid suggestions before returning to user

### Error Handling

**Rate Limiting (429):**
```
Toast: "Too many AI requests"
Description: "Please try again later"
```

**Usage Limit (402):**
```
Toast: "AI usage limit reached"
Description: Error message from API
Action: "Upgrade" button (if upgrade URL provided)
```

**General Failure (500):**
```
Toast: "Failed to generate suggestions"
Description: "Please try again or add stories manually"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Open a large story (>8 story points) in split modal
- [ ] Click "Suggest Splits" button
- [ ] Verify loading state shows spinner
- [ ] Verify 2-5 child stories are generated
- [ ] Check each suggestion has:
  - Clear title
  - Persona-goal statement
  - Detailed description
  - 2+ acceptance criteria
  - Story points 1-5
- [ ] Edit suggestions manually
- [ ] Create split with AI-generated stories
- [ ] Verify parent story links correctly to children

### Error Testing
- [ ] Test rate limiting (make 10+ requests quickly)
- [ ] Test with Free tier user (low token limits)
- [ ] Test with story that doesn't need splitting
- [ ] Test with invalid/missing story data
- [ ] Verify error toasts show correctly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify AI usage tracked in database
- [ ] Verify token counts deducted from organization pool
- [ ] Verify metrics incremented (`ai_story_split_requested`, `ai_story_split_success`, `ai_story_split_failed`)
- [ ] Check audit trail in `ai_generations` table

## Environment Requirements

**Required:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API key for AI generation
- `DATABASE_URL` - For usage tracking and audit

**Recommended:**
- Set up proper AI token pools for test organization
- Configure rate limiting appropriately for environment

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database:** No migrations required (reuses existing `ai_generations` table)

2. **Environment Variables:** Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in production

3. **Rate Limits:** Current setting is 10 requests/minute per user (configurable in `lib/rate-limit.ts`)

4. **Feature Flag:** Story split feature is controlled by environment. To enable:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STORY_SPLIT=true
   ```

5. **Monitoring:** Track these metrics:
   - `story_split_opened` - Modal opens
   - `ai_story_split_requested` - AI suggestions requested
   - `ai_story_split_success` - Successful AI generation
   - `ai_story_split_failed` - Failed AI generation
   - `story_split_committed` - Actual splits created

## User Flow

1. User opens story detail page
2. Clicks "Split story" button in header
3. Split modal opens with INVEST/SPIDR analysis on left
4. Right side shows empty child stories editor
5. User clicks "Suggest Splits" button (with sparkle icon)
6. Button shows loading spinner: "Generating..."
7. AI analyzes story and generates 2-5 suggestions (5-10 seconds)
8. Toast notification: "AI suggestions generated - Created 3 story suggestions using Split by user paths"
9. Child stories populate in editor with full details
10. User can edit, add, or remove stories
11. User clicks "Create N stories" to execute split

## Cost Analysis

**Per Split Operation:**
- Token cost: ~2,500 tokens
- Estimated AI cost: ~$0.025 USD (at Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing)
- Response time: 5-10 seconds average

**Monthly Limits by Tier:**
- Free: 20k tokens = ~8 AI splits
- Solo: 50k tokens = ~20 AI splits
- Team: 300k tokens = ~120 AI splits
- Pro: Unlimited
- Business: 1M tokens = ~400 AI splits
- Enterprise: 5M tokens = ~2,000 AI splits

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure feature adoption:
- AI split suggestions requested vs manual splits
- Conversion rate: suggestions â†’ actual splits
- User satisfaction: Do users edit AI suggestions heavily?
- Quality: INVEST score of AI-generated vs manually-created child stories

## Known Limitations

1. **Story Quality Dependency:** AI suggestions are only as good as the original story description and acceptance criteria
2. **Rate Limits:** Users hitting rate limits frequently may need tier upgrade
3. **Token Costs:** Complex stories may use more tokens than estimated
4. **No Caching:** Each request generates fresh suggestions (no memoization)

## Future Improvements

1. **Learning from Edits:** Track user modifications to improve future suggestions
2. **Suggestion Refinement:** Allow users to ask AI to "try again" with different approach
3. **Batch Splitting:** Split multiple stories at once
4. **Template-Based Splits:** Pre-defined split patterns for common story types
5. **Confidence Scores:** Show AI's confidence in each suggestion
6. **Split History:** Show past splits and allow rollback

## Files Changed

1. `lib/services/ai.service.ts` - Added AI split suggestion method
2. `app/api/stories/[storyId]/ai-split-suggestions/route.ts` - New API endpoint
3. `components/story-split/ChildrenEditor.tsx` - Updated to call AI API
4. `components/story-split/SplitStoryModal.tsx` - Pass storyId to editor
5. `lib/constants.ts` - Added STORY_SPLIT token cost
6. `docs/STORY_SPLIT_FEATURE.md` - Updated documentation

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise in production:

1. **Quick Fix:** Set environment variable to disable AI suggestions:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_SPLIT=false
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback:** Comment out the AI button in `ChildrenEditor.tsx` (lines 139-158)

3. **Full Rollback:** Revert to rule-based suggestions by restoring original `suggestSplits()` function

4. **Emergency:** Delete the API route file to prevent any AI calls
