# Story Split Feature - Deployment Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Completed

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Database Migration - COMPLETE
**Status:** Successfully applied to production database

```bash
# Migration applied to Neon Postgres
‚úì ALTER TABLE stories (added parent_id, split_from_id, is_epic)
‚úì CREATE TABLE story_links
‚úì CREATE TABLE story_split_audit
‚úì CREATE INDEX (8 indexes created for performance)
```

**Database:** `ep-empty-cake-abxwumgz-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb`

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Feature Flag - COMPLETE (Local)
**Status:** Enabled in local `.env` file

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STORY_SPLIT=true
```

**Next Step:** You need to add this to Vercel for production:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables
2. Add variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STORY_SPLIT` = `true`
3. Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click "Save"
5. Redeploy the application

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Local Testing - READY
**Status:** Dev server started

The feature is now available at:
- **Local URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Feature Flag:** Enabled
- **Database:** Connected to production

**How to test:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to any story page (e.g., `/stories/[storyId]`)
4. Hover over the story title
5. Look for the "Split story" button in the header actions
6. Click it to open the split modal

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 4: Production Monitoring - MANUAL
**Status:** Requires access to your observability platform

Once deployed to production, monitor for these metrics:
- `story_split_opened` - When users open the modal
- `story_split_suggested` - When auto-suggestions are used
- `story_split_validated` - When all children pass validation
- `story_split_committed` - When split is executed
- `story_split_blocked` - When split is blocked (with reasons)

**Your telemetry is configured in:**
- `lib/observability/metrics.ts`
- Platform: Check your monitoring dashboard (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)

- [x] Local testing environment ready
- [ ] **ACTION REQUIRED:** Add feature flag to Vercel
- [ ] **ACTION REQUIRED:** Redeploy from Vercel dashboard

## How to Complete Vercel Deployment

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Select your project: synqforge
3. Navigate to: Settings > Environment Variables
4. Click "Add New"
5. Enter:
   - Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STORY_SPLIT
   - Value: true
   - Environments: ‚úì Production ‚úì Preview ‚úì Development
6. Click "Save"
```

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment
Vercel should auto-deploy from the latest push. If not:
```bash
# Option A: Push an empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Vercel deployment for Story Split"
git push clean main

# Option B: Use Vercel dashboard
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "..." on latest commit
3. Select "Redeploy"
```

### Step 3: Verify Production
Once deployed:
```bash
# Check feature flag is set
curl https://synqforge.com/_next/data/[build-id]/stories/[any-story-id].json

# Should see the Split Story button in the header
# Visit: https://synqforge.com/stories/[any-story-id]
```

## Testing Checklist

Once deployed, test these scenarios:

### Happy Path
- [ ] Open a story detail page
- [ ] Click "Split story" button
- [ ] See INVEST analysis panel
- [ ] See SPIDR suggestions (if applicable)
- [ ] Click "Add child story"
- [ ] Fill in all required fields
- [ ] See validation badges (V, I, S, T)
- [ ] Check "Convert parent to epic"
- [ ] Click "Create N stories"
- [ ] Verify child stories are created
- [ ] Verify parent is converted to epic (if checked)

### Blocked Path
- [ ] Try splitting an already-small story (‚â§5 points)
- [ ] See blocking message
- [ ] Verify "Create" button is disabled

### Validation
- [ ] Add child with < 2 acceptance criteria
- [ ] See validation error
- [ ] Add child without persona-goal
- [ ] See validation error
- [ ] Set story points > 5
- [ ] See validation error

## Troubleshooting

### If button doesn't appear:
1. Check feature flag in browser console:
   ```javascript
   console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STORY_SPLIT)
   ```
2. Verify environment variable in Vercel
3. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
4. Check React DevTools for `SplitStoryButton` component

### If build fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Check TypeScript compilation locally: `npm run build`

### If database errors occur:
1. Verify migration ran successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'stories' AND column_name IN ('parent_id', 'split_from_id', 'is_epic');
   ```
2. Check connection string in Vercel environment variables
