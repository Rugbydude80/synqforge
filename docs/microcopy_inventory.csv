faq_pooled_actions_q,How do pooled AI actions work?,config/plans.json,308,308
faq_pooled_actions_a,For Team plans, you get a base pool of 10,000 AI actions plus 1,000 per seat. For example, a 5-person team gets 15,000 actions (10k base + 5k from seats). Any team member can use from this shared pool, making it more flexible than individual allowances. We apply soft caps (2,000 actions/user) to prevent any single user from exhausting the pool.,config/plans.json,309,309
faq_buy_actions_q,Can I buy more AI actions?,config/plans.json,313,313
faq_buy_actions_a,Yes! Core and Team users can purchase AI Actions Packs for £20. Each pack includes 1,000 AI actions that expire after 90 days. You can stack up to 5 packs at once. Starter users can add the AI Booster (£5/month) for an extra 200 actions per month.,config/plans.json,314,314
faq_limit_reached_q,What happens when I reach my monthly limit?,config/plans.json,318,318
faq_limit_reached_a,When you reach your AI action limit, the system will block new AI operations until your monthly allowance resets. You can still manually edit stories, manage projects, and use all non-AI features. Core users with rollover will also have their banked actions available. Consider purchasing an AI Actions Pack or upgrading your plan to continue using AI features.,config/plans.json,319,319
faq_free_more_actions_q,Can free users get more AI time without upgrading?,config/plans.json,323,323
faq_free_more_actions_a,Yes! Starter users can subscribe to the AI Booster add-on for just £5/month, which adds 200 AI actions to your monthly allowance. This is a great way to test more advanced features before committing to a Core plan.,config/plans.json,324,324
faq_team_discount_q,What's the Team plan discount?,config/plans.json,328,328
faq_team_discount_a,The Team plan (£16.99/user) offers 15% savings compared to subscribing 5 users to Pro at £19.99 each. The discount is applied automatically when you have 5 or more seats. Plus, you get pooled AI actions, approval flows, and advanced features not available in Pro.,config/plans.json,329,329
