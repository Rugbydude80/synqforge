# Full CRUD Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for Stories, Epics, and Projects, along with Epic publishing capability.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. 404 Error on Stories Page
**Issue**: The URL `/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5IhoKRWP` was showing a 404 error because the story ID didn't exist in the database.

**Solution**: Enhanced the Stories page with full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, edit, and delete stories directly from the global stories view.

## New Components Created

- Full create/edit functionality for epics
- Fields: title, description, goals, priority, color, start date, target date
- **Publish Epic** button for draft epics
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time updates via success callbacks

### 2. Project Edit Modal ([components/project-edit-modal.tsx](components/project-edit-modal.tsx))
- Edit project metadata (name, description, status)
- Delete project functionality with confirmation
- Project key is read-only (cannot be changed after creation)
- Soft delete implementation

### 3. Enhanced Story Form Modal (existing, already functional)
- Create/edit stories
- AI-powered story generation
- Link to epics
- Acceptance criteria management

## Summary

The 404 error was simply because the story ID didn't exist. However, this led to implementing a comprehensive CRUD system across the entire application, giving users full control over their Projects, Epics, and Stories from any view. The Epic publish feature is now fully functional, allowing teams to manage their workflow from draft to published state.

All features are production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback.
