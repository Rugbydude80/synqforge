# üîê Security Setup Guide - URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Your API Keys Have Been Exposed

Your `.env` and `.env.local` files containing **LIVE CREDENTIALS** were committed to your repository. These keys are now compromised and must be rotated immediately.

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Rotate Stripe Keys (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Click "Reveal live key token"
3. Click "Roll key" to generate a new secret key
4. Save the new key securely
5. Update in Vercel environment variables (DO NOT commit to git)

```bash
# Old key (COMPROMISED): sk_live_[REDACTED]
# Generate new key in Stripe dashboard and use that
```

### Step 2: Rotate Webhook Secret

1. In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Find your webhook endpoint
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Roll signing secret"
4. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel

### Step 3: Rotate Other API Keys

#### Anthropic (Claude)
1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Delete compromised key
3. Create new API key
4. Update `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel

#### OpenRouter
1. Go to [OpenRouter Keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Revoke old key
3. Generate new key
4. Update `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in Vercel

#### Resend (Email)
1. Go to [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Delete old key
3. Create new key
4. Update `RESEND_API_KEY` in Vercel

#### Upstash Redis
1. Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/redis)
2. Select your database
3. Regenerate REST Token
4. Update both `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

#### Ably
1. Go to [Ably Dashboard](https://ably.com/accounts)
2. Navigate to your app ‚Üí API Keys
3. Revoke compromised key
4. Generate new key
5. Update `ABLY_API_KEY` in Vercel

#### GitHub OAuth
1. Go to [GitHub OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Find your application
3. Generate new client secret
4. Update `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in Vercel

### Step 4: Generate New NextAuth Secret

```bash
# Generate a new secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update NEXTAUTH_SECRET in Vercel with the output
```

### Step 5: Update Database Password

This is more complex - coordinate with your team:

1. Create new database user in Neon dashboard
2. Grant same permissions
3. Update `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel
4. Test connection
5. Delete old database user

## üîß Fix Environment Configuration

### Remove Sensitive Files from Git

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Remove .env files from git
git rm --cached .env .env.local

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove sensitive environment files from repository"

# Force push to remote (if needed)
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add ALL variables from `.env.example`
5. Use separate values for Production, Preview, and Development

**NEVER commit `.env*` files again!**

## ‚úÖ Post-Rotation Checklist

After rotating all keys:

- [ ] All Stripe keys rotated (Live Secret Key + Webhook Secret)
- [ ] Anthropic API key rotated
- [ ] OpenRouter API key rotated
- [ ] Resend API key rotated
- [ ] Upstash Redis token rotated
- [ ] Ably API key rotated
- [ ] GitHub OAuth secret rotated
- [ ] NextAuth secret regenerated
- [ ] Database credentials updated (if needed)
- [ ] All new keys added to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] `.env` and `.env.local` removed from git
- [ ] Application tested with new credentials
- [ ] Old keys confirmed revoked in all services

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Future Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Use Vercel environment variables for all secrets
‚úÖ Keep separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with different keys
‚úÖ Use Stripe TEST keys in development
‚úÖ Rotate secrets every 90 days
‚úÖ Use `.env.example` for documentation (no real values)
‚úÖ Enable 2FA on all service accounts

### DON'T:
‚ùå Commit `.env` files to git (they're in `.gitignore` but were committed)
‚ùå Share secrets via email, Slack, or other insecure channels
‚ùå Use production keys in development
‚ùå Store secrets in plain text on your computer
‚ùå Reuse secrets across different services

## üîç Verify Git History is Clean

After removing `.env` files, verify they don't exist in history:

```bash
# Search git history for sensitive patterns
git log --all --full-history --source -- .env .env.local

# If files exist in history, you may need to use git-filter-repo
# to completely remove them from history
```

For complete removal from history:
```bash
# Install git-filter-repo (if not installed)
# macOS: brew install git-filter-repo
# Ubuntu: apt-get install git-filter-repo

# Remove files from entire history
git filter-repo --path .env --path .env.local --invert-paths

# Force push (WARNING: This rewrites history!)
git push origin --force --all
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Rewriting git history affects all team members. Coordinate with your team before doing this.

## üìû Need Help?

If you need assistance with key rotation or security hardening:

1. Consider hiring a security consultant
2. Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
3. Review Vercel's [environment variables documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables)
4. Check each service's security best practices documentation

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time

- **Key Rotation:** 30-45 minutes
- **Vercel Configuration:** 15 minutes  
- **Testing:** 15 minutes
- **Git History Cleanup:** 30 minutes (optional but recommended)

**Total:** ~1.5-2 hours

---

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Due:** As soon as possible (within 24 hours)

Once complete, update `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` to mark security items as complete.
