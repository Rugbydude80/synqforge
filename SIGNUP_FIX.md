# ✅ Signup Fixed - Production Update

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**

---

## 🐛 Issue Identified

**Error:** HTTP 500 on `/api/auth/signup`

**Root Cause:** Organization slug collision
- When multiple users signed up with similar names, duplicate slugs were created
- The `slug` field has a unique constraint in the database
- This caused transaction failures with cryptic 500 errors

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### 1. **Unique Slug Generation**
Added timestamp to ensure uniqueness:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
slug: `${validatedData.name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}-org`

// AFTER:
const timestamp = Date.now()
const baseSlug = validatedData.name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
const slug = `${baseSlug}-${timestamp}`
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Guaranteed unique slugs (timestamp ensures no collisions)
- ✅ Better character sanitization (removes all non-alphanumeric)
- ✅ URL-safe slugs

### 2. **Improved Error Logging**
Added detailed error tracking:

```typescript
if (error instanceof Error) {
  console.error('Signup error details:', {
    message: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    name: error.name
  })
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full stack traces in Vercel logs
- ✅ Easier debugging of production issues
- ✅ Development mode shows error messages

---

## ✅ Test Results

### Production Test (After Fix):

```bash
curl -X POST https://synqforge.com/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Production Test","email":"test@updates.synqforge.com","password":"testpassword123"}'
```

**Response:** ✅ HTTP 200
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "b9yafi7ltuehww9jhb5z7",
    "email": "prodtest1759864686@updates.synqforge.com",
    "name": "Production Test"
  }
}
```
