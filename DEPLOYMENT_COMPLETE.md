### 3. ✅ Production Deployment

- **URL:** https://synqforge-ha3nhqyy9-synq-forge.vercel.app
- **Deployment ID:** 3axUJPzKxU8UjnFfKxDhSmdT3zvd
- **Status:** Live and running

## 🎯 What's Now Live in Production

### Backend Features ✅
- **18 AI operations** protected with fair-usage guards
- **Hard blocking** at 100% usage (402 Payment Required)
- **90% warnings** logged and returned in API responses
- **Token tracking** after every AI operation
- **Monthly automatic reset** via billing period logic
- **Unlimited handling** for Pro/Enterprise plans
- **Backward compatibility** maintained with legacy checks

### API Endpoints ✅
All endpoints return fair-usage data:
- `/api/billing/usage` - Returns token/doc usage stats
- `/api/ai/*` - All AI endpoints check limits before execution
- `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Syncs Stripe metadata to database

### UI Components ✅
- **UsageWarningBanner** - Shows at 90%+ usage on billing page
- **BlockedModal** - Can be used to display blocking errors
- **Billing Page** - Displays live usage warnings

### Database ✅
- **Migration applied** - workspace_usage table created
- **Fair-usage columns** added to organizations table
- **Indexes created** for performance

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Quick Test Flow

1. **Subscribe to Solo Plan** (in test mode):
   ```bash
   # Visit your app and subscribe to Solo plan
   # This should trigger webhook and set limits
   ```

2. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, ai_tokens_included, docs_per_month
   FROM organizations
   WHERE id = 'your-org-id';

   SELECT * FROM workspace_usage
   WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id';
   ```

3. **Test AI Limit** (should see warning at 90%):
   - Use AI features normally
   - Monitor `/api/billing/usage` endpoint
   - When you hit 45,000 tokens (90% of 50,000):
     - Console should log warning
     - Billing page should show warning banner
     - API responses should include `fairUsageWarning`

4. **Test Hard Block** (should block at 100%):
   - Continue using AI until 50,000 tokens
   - Next AI operation should return:
     ```json
     {
       "error": "AI token limit reached (50,000 tokens/month)...",
       "status": 402,
       "upgradeUrl": "/settings/billing",
       "used": 50000,
       "limit": 50000,
       "percentage": 100
     }
     ```

5. **Test Document Upload Limit**:
   - Upload 10 documents (Solo limit)
   - 11th upload should be blocked with 402 error

6. **Test Monthly Reset**:
   - Manually update `billing_period_start` in workspace_usage to last month
   - Make an AI call
   - `getOrCreateWorkspaceUsage()` should create new record with reset counters

## 📊 Monitoring Fair-Usage in Production

### Check Current Usage

```bash
# Via API (authenticated)
curl -X GET "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/billing/usage?organizationId=XXX" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

# Response includes:
{
  "fairUsage": {
    "tokens": {
      "used": 12500,
      "limit": 50000,
      "remaining": 37500,
      "percentage": 25,
      "isWarning": false,
      "isBlocked": false
    },
    "docs": {
      "used": 3,
      "limit": 10,
      "remaining": 7,
      "percentage": 30,
      "isWarning": false,
      "isBlocked": false
    },
    "billingPeriod": {
      "start": "2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "end": "2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Check Database Directly

```sql
-- Check organization limits
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  plan,
  ai_tokens_included,
  docs_per_month,
  throughput_spm,
  bulk_story_limit,
  max_pages_per_upload
FROM organizations
WHERE plan = 'solo';

-- Check current usage
SELECT
  organization_id,
  tokens_used,
  tokens_limit,
  docs_ingested,
  docs_limit,
  billing_period_start,
  billing_period_end,
  last_reset_at
FROM workspace_usage
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
ORDER BY billing_period_start DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check usage percentage
SELECT
  organization_id,
  tokens_used,
  tokens_limit,
  ROUND((tokens_used::decimal / tokens_limit) * 100, 2) as token_percentage,
  docs_ingested,
  docs_limit,
  ROUND((docs_ingested::decimal / docs_limit) * 100, 2) as doc_percentage
FROM workspace_usage
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
  AND billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND billing_period_end > NOW();
```

### Monitor Stripe Webhooks

```bash
# Watch webhook events
stripe events list --limit 10

# Test webhook with CLI
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Limits not updating after subscription

**Check:**
1. Webhook is receiving events: `stripe events list`
2. Webhook has correct metadata on Price
3. Organization record updated: `SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE id='...'`
4. Workspace usage initialized: `SELECT * FROM workspace_usage WHERE organization_id='...'`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Manually trigger webhook
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Or update organization directly
UPDATE organizations
SET ai_tokens_included = 50000, docs_per_month = 10
WHERE id = 'your-org-id';
```

### Issue: Still able to use AI after hitting limit

**Check:**
1. Guard function is being called: Check console logs for "Fair-usage warning"
2. Token count is correct: `SELECT tokens_used FROM workspace_usage...`
3. Billing period is current: Check `billing_period_start` and `billing_period_end`

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Manually set tokens to limit
UPDATE workspace_usage
SET tokens_used = tokens_limit
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id';
```

### Issue: Warnings not showing on billing page

**Check:**
1. Frontend is fetching data: Check Network tab for `/api/billing/usage`
2. Response includes `fairUsage`: Check API response
3. Usage >= 90%: `SELECT (tokens_used::decimal / tokens_limit) * 100 FROM workspace_usage...`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Vercel logs
vercel logs --follow

# Or check browser console for errors
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### What to Monitor:

1. **Subscription Conversions**:
   - Track users hitting 90% threshold
   - Monitor upgrade rate after seeing warning
   - Measure time from warning to upgrade

2. **Fair-Usage Effectiveness**:
   - % of users staying within limits
   - Average token usage per plan
   - Document upload patterns

3. **User Experience**:
   - 402 error rate (should be very low after warnings)
   - Support tickets about limits
   - User feedback on warnings

4. **Revenue Impact**:
   - Upgrade revenue from fair-usage warnings
   - Plan distribution changes
   - Churn rate vs limits
