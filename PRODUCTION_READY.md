## üìä Production Metrics to Monitor

### Usage Metrics
Track these in your analytics:
- Token usage per organization
- Document upload patterns
- 90% warning frequency
- 402 block frequency
- Upgrade conversion rate (90% ‚Üí upgrade)

### System Health
Monitor these regularly:
```bash
# Check workspace usage records
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_orgs,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN tokens_used >= tokens_limit * 0.9 THEN 1 END) as at_90_percent,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN tokens_used >= tokens_limit THEN 1 END) as blocked
FROM workspace_usage
WHERE billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND billing_period_end > NOW();
"

# Check Stripe webhook events
stripe events list --limit 10

# Check Vercel logs
vercel logs --follow
```

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Conversion Rate:** Users upgrading after seeing warnings
2. **Block Rate:** % of API calls returning 402
3. **Usage Distribution:** Average tokens/docs per plan
4. **Support Tickets:** Issues related to limits
5. **Churn:** Users leaving due to limits

## üõ†Ô∏è Operations Manual

### How to Check Organization Usage

```sql
-- Get current usage for an organization
SELECT
  o.name,
  o.plan,
  wu.tokens_used,
  wu.tokens_limit,
  ROUND((wu.tokens_used::decimal / wu.tokens_limit) * 100, 2) as token_pct,
  wu.docs_ingested,
  wu.docs_limit,
  ROUND((wu.docs_ingested::decimal / wu.docs_limit) * 100, 2) as doc_pct,
  wu.billing_period_start,
  wu.billing_period_end
FROM workspace_usage wu
JOIN organizations o ON o.id = wu.organization_id
WHERE wu.organization_id = 'your-org-id'
  AND wu.billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND wu.billing_period_end > NOW();
```

### How to Manually Reset Usage (Emergency)

```sql
-- Reset tokens for an organization
UPDATE workspace_usage
SET tokens_used = 0, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
  AND billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND billing_period_end > NOW();

-- Reset docs for an organization
UPDATE workspace_usage
SET docs_ingested = 0, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
  AND billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND billing_period_end > NOW();
```

### How to Manually Increase Limits (Emergency)

```sql
-- Give org more tokens this month
UPDATE workspace_usage
SET tokens_limit = 100000, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
  AND billing_period_start <= NOW()
  AND billing_period_end > NOW();

-- Update organization permanent limits
UPDATE organizations
SET ai_tokens_included = 100000,
    docs_per_month = 50,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'your-org-id';
```

### How to Test the System

```bash
# Run automated guard tests
DATABASE_URL="your-prod-db-url" npx tsx test-guards.ts

# Check Stripe metadata
stripe prices retrieve price_1SIZdYJBjlYCYeTTAnSJ5elk | grep -A 3 metadata

# Verify environment variables
vercel env ls | grep STRIPE_PRICE

# Check deployment status
vercel ls synqforge
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: User reports AI not working

**Check:**
1. Are they at 100% token usage?
```sql
SELECT tokens_used, tokens_limit
FROM workspace_usage
WHERE organization_id = 'org-id';
```

2. Check API logs for 402 errors:
```bash
vercel logs --follow | grep "402"
```

3. Check billing page shows warning

**Fix:**
- If legitimate: Manually increase limit or reset usage
- If bug: Check guard function logic
- If billing issue: Update Stripe subscription

### Issue: Warning not showing at 90%

**Check:**
1. Verify usage is actually >= 90%
2. Check API returns `fairUsageWarning` in response
3. Check billing page component renders banner
4. Check browser console for errors

**Fix:**
- Verify guard function returns `isWarning: true`
- Check UsageWarningBanner component props
- Verify API endpoint returns fairUsage data

### Issue: Monthly reset not working

**Check:**
1. Check if new workspace_usage record created for new month
```sql
SELECT * FROM workspace_usage
WHERE organization_id = 'org-id'
ORDER BY billing_period_start DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

**Fix:**
- `getOrCreateWorkspaceUsage()` should auto-create new record
- If not, manually create record for current month
- Check `getCurrentBillingPeriod()` function

### Issue: Webhook not syncing limits

**Check:**
1. Stripe webhook events:
```bash
stripe events list --limit 10
```

2. Vercel webhook logs:
```bash
vercel logs | grep webhook
```

3. Organization limits:
```sql
SELECT ai_tokens_included, docs_per_month
FROM organizations
WHERE id = 'org-id';
```

**Fix:**
- Manually trigger webhook: `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`
- Manually update organization limits via SQL
- Check webhook secret is correct in env vars

## üìà Success Metrics (First Week)

Track these metrics to validate the system:

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ 0% of users should hit 100% without warning first
- ‚úÖ <5% of users should hit 90% threshold
- ‚úÖ 90%+ of warned users should upgrade or reduce usage
- ‚úÖ <1% of API calls should return 402
- ‚úÖ 0 support tickets about unexpected blocks

### Red Flags:
- üö® Many 402 errors without prior warnings
- üö® Users reporting blocks below 100% usage
- üö® Monthly reset not happening
- üö® Unlimited plans being blocked
- üö® Warnings showing below 90%
