## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Option 1: Quick tests (no server needed)
npm run test:quick

# Option 2: Full integration tests (requires running server)
npm run test:ai

# Option 3: Run specific test file
npm run test:ai-backlog-builder
```

### With Authentication (Full Tests)

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Get auth token
# - Sign in at http://localhost:3000
# - Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
# - Copy 'next-auth.session-token'

# 3. Export token
export TEST_AUTH_TOKEN='your-token-here'

# 4. Run tests
npm run test:ai
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Automated test runs on every push
- ✅ PR validation before merge
- ✅ Multi-job parallel execution
- ✅ Database setup and migration
- ✅ Test result artifacts

### Trigger Paths
Tests run automatically when changes are made to:
- `app/api/ai/**`
- `lib/ai/**`
- `lib/services/ai*.ts`
- `lib/validations/ai.ts`
- `tests/integration/ai-backlog-builder.test.ts`

## 📝 Test Scenarios Covered

### ✅ Scenario 1: Large Story Decomposition
Tests the decomposition engine's ability to break down complex stories into capabilities.

### ✅ Scenario 2: Story Generation
Tests story generation with validation rules:
- Category filtering (performance + no-results + AND-logic)
- Mobile interface (WCAG + touch targets + accessibility)
- Persistence (session state)

### ✅ Scenario 3: Auto-Fix
Tests automatic correction transformations:
- Split compound Then clauses
- Insert missing no-results AC
- Add performance timing
- Rewrite passive voice

### ✅ Scenario 4: Idempotency
Tests duplicate prevention for stories and epics using correlation keys.

### ✅ Scenario 5: Epic Linkage
Tests parent/sibling relationship management when soft cap is exceeded.

### ✅ Scenario 6: Quality Scoring
Tests the quality scoring algorithm and ready-for-sprint gate logic.

### ✅ Scenario 7: Schema Validation
Tests API boundary validation with strict schemas.

### ✅ Scenario 8: Observability
Tests PII redaction and metrics emission.

### ✅ End-to-End Flow
Tests complete workflow: decompose → generate → validate → build epic.
