# Immediate Fix for Story Not Found Issue

## TL;DR
The story exists and shows in your list, but clicking it shows "Story Not Found". This is likely due to **stale deployment cache** on the specific story detail page route.

## Quick Fix (Try These in Order)

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh the Browser (30 seconds)
1. Open https://synqforge.com/stories
2. Click on the story
3. When "Story Not Found" appears, do a **hard refresh**:
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
4. Check if the story now loads

### Fix 2: Clear Browser Cache (1 minute)
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button ‚Üí **Empty Cache and Hard Reload**
3. Or clear all browser cache for synqforge.com
4. Try accessing the story again

### Fix 3: Force Vercel to Rebuild Pages (2 minutes)
The API routes are fixed, but the **page routes** might still be cached.

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí **Redeploy**
3. **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
4. Wait for deployment
5. Try again

### Fix 4: Check if Route Exists in Build
```bash
# Check if the story page route was built
npm run build 2>&1 | grep "stories"
```

Expected output:
```
‚óã /stories
∆í /stories/[storyId]
```

If `/stories/[storyId]` is missing, there's a build issue.

## Debug: What's Really Happening?

Let me check the actual error. Open DevTools console when you click the story and look for:

### 1. Network Tab
- Find the request to `/api/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP`
- Check:
  - Status code: 404? 403? 500?
  - Response body: What's the error message?
  - Request headers: Is `Cookie` header included?

### 2. Console Tab
Look for errors like:
- `"Story not found"`
- `"Access denied"`
- `"Failed to fetch story"`
- Any 404/403/500 errors

## Most Likely Cause: Page Route Cache

Your API endpoints work (we confirmed with curl), but the **Next.js page route** at `/app/stories/[storyId]/page.tsx` might be serving a cached version.

### Why This Happens:
1. You redeployed ‚Üí API routes refreshed ‚úÖ
2. But Next.js might have cached the page components
3. The page tries to fetch from API
4. API works, but page shows cached "not found" state

### Solution:
**Force a complete cache clear and redeploy**

```bash
# Option 1: Via Vercel
# Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí "Invalidate Cache" button
# Then redeploy

# Option 2: Via CLI
vercel --prod --force --yes

# Option 3: Delete .next and redeploy
rm -rf .next
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Clear build cache" --allow-empty
git push clean New
```

## Test Script

Run this to see the actual API response:

```bash
# This will show you what the API is actually returning
# You'll need to get your session cookie from browser DevTools first

curl -v -H "Cookie: __Secure-next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  https://synqforge.com/api/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP 2>&1 | tee story-response.txt
```

Look for:
- **200 OK** = Story exists and you have access ‚úÖ
- **404 Not Found** = Story doesn't exist or wrong org
- **403 Forbidden** = You don't have permission
- **401 Unauthorized** = Session expired

## Alternative: Check Production Database

If you want to be 100% certain, run this query in production DB:

```sql
-- Check if the story exists and matches your organization
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.title,
  s."organizationId",
  s.status,
  u.email as your_email,
  u."organizationId" as your_org_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN s."organizationId" = u."organizationId" THEN '‚úÖ MATCH'
    ELSE '‚ùå MISMATCH'
  END as access_status
FROM stories s
CROSS JOIN users u
WHERE s.id = 'M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP'
  AND u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com'  -- Replace with your email
LIMIT 1;
```

If you see `‚ùå MISMATCH`, then update the story:

```sql
-- Fix organization mismatch
UPDATE stories
SET "organizationId" = (
  SELECT "organizationId" 
  FROM users 
  WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com' 
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE id = 'M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP';
```

## Expected Behavior vs Current

### Expected:
1. User clicks story in list
2. Browser navigates to `/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP`
3. Page makes API call to `/api/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP`
4. API returns story data
5. Page displays story details

### What's Probably Happening:
1. User clicks story in list ‚úÖ
2. Browser navigates to `/stories/M9cCXqc2QCcir5lhoKRWP` ‚úÖ
3. Page makes API call ‚ùì
4. Either:
   - API returns 404 (story in wrong org) OR
   - API returns 200 but page shows cached "not found" OR
   - API call fails silently

## Action Plan

**Step 1:** Try hard refresh (Fix 1)  
**Step 2:** Check DevTools Network/Console  
**Step 3:** Report back what you see  
**Step 4:** We'll apply the appropriate fix

---

**Most likely you just need to:**
1. Hard refresh the browser, OR
2. Redeploy with clean cache one more time
