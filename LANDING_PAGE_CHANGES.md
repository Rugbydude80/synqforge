2. **Run Lighthouse audit:**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to Lighthouse tab
   - Run audit for mobile
   - Target scores: Performance ≥85, Accessibility ≥95, SEO ≥90

3. **Verify CTAs:**

   - Secondary CTA → `#example-output` (scroll to section)
   - Sample download → `/samples/synqforge-sample.docx`

4. **Setup Analytics:**
   - Configure tracking for `data-cta` attributes

## Files to Review

1. `/app/page.tsx` — Main landing page composition

3. `/LANDING_PAGE_README.md` — Maintenance guide
4. `/public/samples/synqforge-sample.docx` — Sample export file

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback, the original landing page had:
- Hero with "Build Better Products 110x Faster"
- Features grid with 6 cards
- Single CTA section at bottom

All changes are in discrete component files, so you can revert by restoring the original `/app/page.tsx` if needed.
