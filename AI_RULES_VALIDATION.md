# AI Rules & Enforcement Validation
**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: ✅ ALL AI RULES VERIFIED & WORKING

## Executive Summary

All AI usage limits and subscription rules are correctly implemented and enforced across the platform. Manual story creation is unlimited, while all AI operations are properly gated by token limits, purchased tokens, and subscription tiers.

---

## 🎯 Core AI Rules

### Rule #1: AI Token Limits (HARD BLOCK)
**Status**: ✅ WORKING  
**Location**: `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` → `canUseAI()`

```typescript
✅ Checks monthly AI token allowance before EVERY AI operation
✅ Blocks operation if tokens exhausted (returns 402 Payment Required)
✅ Falls back to purchased tokens if monthly limit reached
✅ Intelligently deducts from monthly first, then purchased tokens
✅ Shows 90% warning when approaching limit
```

**Enforcement Flow**:
1. User initiates AI operation
2. System calculates estimated token cost
3. Checks monthly allowance (`workspaceUsage.tokensUsed` vs `tokensLimit`)
4. If insufficient, checks `tokenBalances` for purchased tokens
5. If still insufficient → **BLOCKS** with 402 error
6. If allowed → operation proceeds
7. After completion → `incrementTokenUsage()` deducts tokens intelligently

---

### Rule #2: Purchased Token Booster Packages
**Status**: ✅ WORKING (Fixed 2025-10-27)  
**Location**: `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` + `lib/services/ai-usage.service.ts`

```typescript
✅ Users can purchase token packs via Stripe
✅ Tokens stored in `tokenBalances` table
✅ Automatically checked when monthly tokens exhausted
✅ Properly deducted when used (via incrementTokenUsage)
✅ Displayed in usage dashboard
```

**Purchase Flow**:
1. User clicks "Buy Tokens" → Creates Stripe checkout
2. Stripe webhook fires on payment success
3. `addPurchasedTokens()` adds to `tokenBalances.purchasedTokens`
4. Tokens immediately available for use
5. UI shows "X purchased tokens available"

**Usage Flow**:
1. Monthly tokens exhausted → System checks `tokenBalances`
2. If purchased tokens available → Operation allowed
3. Token deduction: Monthly first, then purchased (smart splitting)
4. Example: Need 5,000 tokens, have 1,000 monthly + 10,000 purchased
   - Uses 1,000 from monthly → Sets monthly to limit
   - Uses 4,000 from purchased → Deducts from balance

---

### Rule #3: Document Ingestion Limits
**Status**: ✅ WORKING  
**Location**: `lib/billing/fair-usage-guards.ts` → `canIngestDocument()`

```typescript
✅ Tracks documents ingested per month (`workspaceUsage.docsIngested`)
✅ Blocks when limit reached (402 Payment Required)
✅ Shows 90% warning
✅ Enforced on /api/ai/analyze-document
```

---

### Rule #4: AI Generation Count Limits
**Status**: ✅ WORKING  
**Location**: `lib/services/ai-usage.service.ts` → `checkAIUsageLimit()`

```typescript
✅ Tracks number of AI generations per month
✅ Enforced via legacy checkAIUsageLimit (being migrated to token-based)
✅ Prevents excessive generation requests
```

---

### Rule #5: Manual Story Creation is UNLIMITED
**Status**: ✅ CONFIRMED (Fixed 2025-10-27)  
**Location**: `app/api/stories/route.ts`

```typescript
✅ NO checks on manual story creation
✅ Users can create unlimited stories manually
✅ Only AI-generated stories consume AI tokens
✅ batch-create-stories also unlimited (manual batch)
```

**What Changed**:
- **REMOVED**: Story count limit checks from `/api/stories` POST endpoint
- **REMOVED**: "Stories This Month" card from billing dashboard
- **KEPT**: Project count limits (still enforced)
- **KEPT**: AI token limits (still enforced)

## 📊 AI Endpoints - Token Enforcement Matrix

| Endpoint | Token Check | Purchased Tokens | Status |
|----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| `/api/ai/generate-stories` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/generate-epic` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/generate-single-story` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/validate-story` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/analyze-document` | ✅ + Doc Limit | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/decompose` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/build-epic` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/generate-from-capability` | ✅ | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/autopilot` (POST) | ✅ (in service) | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/ac-validator` (POST) | ✅ (in service) | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/test-generator` | ✅ (in service) | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/planning` | ✅ (in service) | ✅ | PROTECTED |
| `/api/ai/scoring` | ✅ (in service) | ✅ | PROTECTED |

**Note**: Some endpoints check limits at the **service layer** (autopilot, ac-validator, test-generator, planning, scoring) rather than at the route handler. This is acceptable as long as the check happens before AI calls.

## 🔒 Subscription Feature Gating

### Middleware Tier Enforcement
**Location**: `middleware.ts` + `lib/middleware/subscription-guard-edge.ts`

| Feature | Required Tier | Enforced | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Export (Jira/Linear) | Pro+ | ✅ | WORKING |
| Bulk Operations | Pro+ | ✅ | WORKING |
| Document Analysis | Pro+ | ✅ | WORKING |
| Team Features | Team+ | ✅ | WORKING |
| Approval Flows | Team+ | ✅ | WORKING |
| SSO/SAML | Enterprise | ✅ | WORKING |

### API-Level Feature Checks
**Location**: Various API endpoints + `lib/services/`

```typescript
✅ Document analysis requires Pro tier
✅ Autopilot requires feature flag
✅ AC Validator requires feature flag
✅ Advanced AI modules gated by tier
✅ Fail-closed security (deny on error)
```
