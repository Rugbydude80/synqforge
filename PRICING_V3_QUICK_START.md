## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Developers
- All pricing data lives in `config/plans.json` - edit there first
- Constants in `lib/constants.ts` must match `plans.json`
- Tests will catch inconsistencies
- Dynamic Tailwind classes are safelisted
- Backward compatibility maintained with `pro` tier alias

### For Product Managers
- Pro (Collaborative) marked as "Most Popular" (line 19 in plans.json)
- Team tier shows 15% discount badge automatically
- Add-on eligibility enforced at checkout
- Migration path documented for existing users

### For QA
- Use `PRICING_V3_QA_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing
- 200+ checkpoints covering desktop, mobile, tablet, checkout, security
- All 48 unit tests passing
- Ready for E2E testing

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Price ID not configured"
→ Check Vercel environment variables are set

### "Dynamic color classes not working"
→ Already fixed - safelist added to tailwind.config.ts

### "Old pricing showing"
→ Clear CDN cache: `vercel --prod --force`

### "Checkout redirect failing"
→ Verify Stripe price IDs match environment variables

### Tests failing
→ Should all pass - check if plans.json was edited
