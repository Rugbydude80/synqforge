# üß™ Stripe Webhook Testing Guide - Production

**Deployment:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Production deployed, webhooks need verification  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for payment processing

---

## üéØ What We're Testing

Your production deployment includes fixes to Stripe webhook handlers. We need to verify:

1. ‚úÖ Webhooks are receiving events from Stripe
2. ‚úÖ Signature verification is working
3. ‚úÖ Subscription events are processed correctly
4. ‚úÖ Database updates are happening
5. ‚úÖ Error handling is working

---

## üîç Step 1: Check Stripe Dashboard

### View Recent Webhook Deliveries

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click on your production webhook endpoint
3. Look for recent events in the "Recent deliveries" section

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ **200 OK responses** - Webhooks processed successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **4xx/5xx errors** - Problems with webhook processing
- üìä **Response times** - Should be < 5 seconds

### Common Events to Monitor

| Event Type | What It Does | Priority |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| `customer.subscription.created` | New subscription | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Subscription changed | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Subscription cancelled | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | Payment successful | üü° HIGH |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Payment failed | üü° HIGH |
| `checkout.session.completed` | Checkout completed | üü° HIGH |

## üß™ Step 2: Test with Stripe CLI (Recommended)

### Install Stripe CLI

If not already installed:
```bash
# macOS
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Or download from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
```

### Login to Stripe
```bash
stripe login
```

### Forward Webhooks to Production

**Option A: Test Against Production (Recommended)**
```bash
# This sends test events to your production webhook endpoint
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created \
  --customer=cus_test123 \
  --price=price_test123
```

**Option B: Forward to Local (For Debugging)**
```bash
# Forward live events to local server for debugging
stripe listen --forward-to https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### Test Critical Events

Run each of these commands and verify the results:

#### 1. Test Subscription Created
```bash
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
```

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook receives event
- Database: New row in `organizations` table with subscription data
- Status: `trialing` or `active`

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  name,
  subscription_tier,
  subscription_status,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  stripe_price_id
FROM organizations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### 2. Test Subscription Updated
```bash
stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated
```

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook receives event
- Database: Organization subscription status updated
- Timestamps updated

#### 3. Test Subscription Deleted
```bash
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
```

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook receives event
- Database: `subscription_status` ‚Üí `canceled`
- `canceled_at` timestamp set

#### 4. Test Payment Succeeded
```bash
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
```

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook receives event
- Database: `subscription_status` ‚Üí `active`
- `subscription_renewal_at` updated

#### 5. Test Payment Failed
```bash
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
```

**Expected Result:**
- Webhook receives event
- Database: `subscription_status` ‚Üí `past_due`
- Warning email sent (if configured)

---

## üìä Step 3: Verify Database Updates

### Check Recent Webhook Processing

Connect to your Neon database and run:

```sql
-- Check recent subscription updates
SELECT 
  o.name AS organization_name,
  o.subscription_tier,
  o.subscription_status,
  o.stripe_subscription_id,
  o.subscription_renewal_at,
  o.updated_at,
  (NOW() - o.updated_at) AS seconds_since_update
FROM organizations o
WHERE o.stripe_subscription_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY o.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Subscription Data Integrity

```sql
-- Check for any inconsistencies
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_subscriptions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) AS active,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 END) AS canceled,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'past_due' THEN 1 END) AS past_due,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'trialing' THEN 1 END) AS trialing,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN subscription_status IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS no_status
FROM organizations
WHERE stripe_subscription_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### Check for Webhook Processing Errors

```sql
-- If you have a webhook_logs table (recommended to add)
SELECT 
  event_type,
  status_code,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM webhook_logs
WHERE status_code >= 400
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## üîç Step 4: Monitor Application Logs

### Vercel Logs

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Filter by `/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Look for:**
```
‚úÖ "Webhook signature verified"
‚úÖ "Processing subscription.created event"
‚úÖ "Subscription updated for organization: org_xxx"
‚ùå "Webhook signature verification failed"
‚ùå "Error processing webhook"
```

### Sentry Errors (If Configured)

1. Check [Sentry Dashboard](https://sentry.io)
2. Filter by:
   - URL: `/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Time: Last 24 hours

**Common errors to watch for:**
- Signature verification failures
- Database connection errors
- Type errors (should be fixed now!)
- Timeout errors

---

## üß™ Step 5: End-to-End Test (Most Important!)

### Create a Real Test Subscription

1. **Use Stripe Test Mode:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard
   - Toggle to "Test mode" (top right)
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

2. **Create a subscription through your app:**
   ```
   https://your-production-domain.com/auth/signup
   ```

3. **Select a paid plan** (Solo, Team, or Enterprise)

4. **Complete checkout with test card:**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVC: Any 3 digits
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits

5. **Verify the flow:**
   - ‚úÖ Checkout session created
   - ‚úÖ Redirected to success page
   - ‚úÖ Webhook `checkout.session.completed` received
   - ‚úÖ Webhook `customer.subscription.created` received
   - ‚úÖ Organization updated in database
   - ‚úÖ User can access paid features

### Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check the organization that was just created
SELECT 
  o.name,
  o.subscription_tier,
  o.subscription_status,
  o.stripe_customer_id,
  o.stripe_subscription_id,
  o.stripe_price_id,
  o.subscription_renewal_at,
  o.created_at,
  o.updated_at
FROM organizations o
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected values:**
- `subscription_tier`: Should match selected plan (solo/team/enterprise)
- `subscription_status`: Should be `trialing` or `active`
- `stripe_customer_id`: Should start with `cus_`
- `stripe_subscription_id`: Should start with `sub_`
- `stripe_price_id`: Should match your configured price IDs

## üî¥ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: 401 Unauthorized

**Symptom:** Stripe webhooks return 401 errors

**Causes:**
- Webhook secret doesn't match
- Signature verification failing

**Fix:**
```bash
# Get your webhook signing secret from Stripe Dashboard
# Update STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Vercel environment variables
```

### Issue 2: 500 Internal Server Error

**Symptom:** Webhooks fail with 500 errors

**Causes:**
- Type errors (should be fixed)
- Database connection issues
- Missing environment variables

**Debug:**
1. Check Vercel logs for specific error
2. Check Sentry for stack trace
3. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

### Issue 3: Subscription Created but Not Updated

**Symptom:** Stripe shows subscription created, but database not updated

**Causes:**
- Event not processed
- Database update failed
- Organization not found

**Debug:**
```sql
-- Check if organization has Stripe customer ID
SELECT id, name, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id
FROM organizations
WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'cus_YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID';
```

### Issue 4: Type Errors on Subscription Fields

**Symptom:** Errors accessing `current_period_end`, etc.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SHOULD BE FIXED** in latest deployment

**Verification:**
Check that these lines are in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`:
```typescript
currentPeriodStart: (subscription as {current_period_start?: number}).current_period_start
  ? new Date((subscription as {current_period_start?: number}).current_period_start! * 1000)
  : null,
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your webhooks are working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ **Stripe Dashboard shows 200 OK responses** for webhook deliveries
2. ‚úÖ **Database updates match Stripe events** (subscriptions created, updated, deleted)
3. ‚úÖ **No errors in Vercel logs** related to webhooks
4. ‚úÖ **No Sentry errors** for webhook processing
5. ‚úÖ **End-to-end test successful** (signup ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí subscription active)
6. ‚úÖ **Subscription fields populated correctly** in database

---

## üìä Webhook Health Dashboard (Recommended Setup)

### Add Webhook Monitoring

Create a simple monitoring endpoint:

**File:** `app/api/admin/webhook-health/route.ts`

```typescript
import { db } from '@/lib/db'
import { organizations } from '@/lib/db/schema'
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET() {
  // Check recent webhook processing
  const last24Hours = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  
  const stats = await db
    .select({
      total: sql<number>`count(*)`,
      active: sql<number>`count(case when subscription_status = 'active' then 1 end)`,
      canceled: sql<number>`count(case when subscription_status = 'canceled' then 1 end)`,
      recentUpdates: sql<number>`count(case when updated_at > ${last24Hours} then 1 end)`,
    })
    .from(organizations)
    .where(sql`stripe_subscription_id IS NOT NULL`)

  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    subscriptions: stats[0],
  })
}
```

**Access:** `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/webhook-health`

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Verification

### If All Tests Pass ‚úÖ

1. **Enable production webhooks** (if not already)
2. **Set up monitoring alerts** (Sentry, Vercel notifications)
3. **Document webhook behavior** for team
4. **Schedule regular health checks** (weekly)

### If Any Tests Fail ‚ùå

1. **Check specific error messages** in logs
2. **Verify environment variables** in Vercel
3. **Test locally** with Stripe CLI forwarding
4. **Check database connectivity** from Vercel
5. **Review Stripe API version compatibility**
